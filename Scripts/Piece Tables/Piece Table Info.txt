the position tables are flipped due to how the pieces are stored in the piece array
the 0th position in the piece array is the 0th square index (the bottom left square) 
however in these table arrays it would be the 56th position
maybe revisit it and see whether reording the piece array would be more sensible...
for now though, the position tables are just flipped and the top row is the bottom row, bottom row the top, etc..
